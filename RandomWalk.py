"""
The class used for generate random walk (support metapath random walk and none metapath random walk)
when the meta schema is set, there is assumption that the there is no multi edge relation.
basically, there is only one edge type bewteen the same node type.

e.g. there are two types of nodes: Author and Paper, we only have one edge type between these two node type,
which means the person is the author of the paper

support two modes:
    if meta_path_schema is set, will generate random walk based on meta_path_schema
    if meta_path_schema is not set, will generate random walk ingore the edge type and node type
